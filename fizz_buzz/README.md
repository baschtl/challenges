# Fizz Buzz

A challenge from [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/1).

An input file is parsed line by line where each line consists of three numbers separated by a space:

1. first divider A,
2. second divider B,
3. the end of counting N.

The script counts from 1 to N for each line and replaces

* numbers dividable by A with `F`,
* numbers dividable by B with `B` and
* numbers dividable by A and B with `FB`.

The result for each input line is printed to a new line on the console.
