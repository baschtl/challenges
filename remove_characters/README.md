# Remove characters

A challenge from [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/13).

An input file which consists of lines of text is given and read line by line. Each line consists of two parts separated by a comma:
* a string,
* a sequence of characters.

The script outputs each string with all characters removed from it that appear in the sequence of characters.
