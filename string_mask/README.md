# String mask

A challenge from [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/199).

An input file which consists of lines of text is given and read line by line. Each line consists of two parts separated by an empty space:
* an actual word,
* a binary cipher.

The script outputs each word adapted according to the cipher. If the cipher at a certain index is `1` the character of the word at that specific position if made upper case. If it is a `0` it is made lower case.
